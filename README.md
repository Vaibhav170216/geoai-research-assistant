# 📂 Dataset

The knowledge base was built by querying the [arXiv API](https://arxiv.org/help/api) across 13 topic-specific searches spanning GeoAI, Earth Observation, Remote Sensing, Vision Transformers and Foundation Models, sorted by most recent submission date. After collection, this indexes around **1,000 research papers**.

### Indexing Pipeline

The `build_index.py` script orchestrates the full ingestion-to-index flow:

1. **Ingesting** - `ingest.py` queries the arXiv API across the 13 topic searches and returns paper metadata (title, abstract, authors, year, topic, URL).
2. **Keyword index** - papers are added to a `TextSearchIndex` (SQLite FTS5), searchable on `title`, `authors` and `abstract`, with `topic` as a filterable keyword field. Saved to `geoai.db`.
3. **Vector index** - `build_embeddings.py` encodes the same documents into sentence-transformer embeddings for semantic search. Saved to `geoai_embeddings.pkl`.


Each document contains:

- Title
- Abstract
- Authors
- Publication Year
- Topic
- Source URL

# 📊 Evaluation Pipeline

```text

       │
       ▼

Evaluation Metrics
```

The evaluation pipeline automatically:

- Generates evaluation questions from the indexed papers.
- Runs the complete RAG pipeline.
- Evaluates generated answers using Ragas.
- Produces quantitative evaluation reports.

# 📈 Evaluation Results

| Metric | Score |
|---------|------:|
| Faithfulness | **0.7386** |
| Answer Relevancy | **0.8267** |
| Context Precision | **0.8600** |

### Interpretation

- ✅ Responses remain well grounded in retrieved literature.
- ✅ High answer relevancy indicates the assistant answers user questions effectively.
- ✅ Hybrid retrieval consistently retrieves relevant scientific papers.

# 📊 Monitoring Dashboard

The application includes an end-to-end monitoring pipeline for tracking RAG usage and system behavior.

Every user query is automatically logged to PostgreSQL, enabling real-time visualization through Grafana.

### Logged Metrics

- User queries
- Retrieved document count
- Response latency
- Token usage
- Timestamp
- LLM model
- Retrieval metadata

This monitoring stack provides valuable insights into application usage, debugging and performance trends.

# 🚀 Running Locally

Clone the repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Vaibhav170216/geoai-research-assistant.git

cd geoai-research-assistant
```

Install dependencies

```bash
uv sync
```

Create a `.env`

```text
GROQ_API_KEY=your_groq_api_key
```

Build the index

```bash
python build_index.py
```

```bash
streamlit run app.py
```

Alternatively if you want to deplot whole application end-to-end then read the below instructions -

# Dockerized Deployment

## Prerequisites

Before running the project, ensure you have the following installed:

- Docker Desktop (with WSL2 enabled)
- Git
- Groq API Key

---

## Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Vaibhav170216/geoai-research-assistant.git

cd geoai-research-assistant
```

---

## Configure Environment Variables

Create a `.env` file in the project root:

```text
GROQ_API_KEY=your_groq_api_key
```

---

## Build and Run

Build the Docker images and start all services:

```bash
docker compose up --build
```

The first build may take several minutes as dependencies are downloaded.

---

## Available Services

| Service | URL | Description |
|----------|-----|-------------|
| Streamlit App | http://localhost:8501 | GeoAI Research Assistant |
| Grafana Dashboard | http://localhost:3000 | Monitoring Dashboard |
| PostgreSQL | localhost:5432 | Request Logging Database |

---

## Stopping the Application

Stop all running containers:

```bash
docker compose down
```

To remove containers, networks, and volumes:

```bash
docker compose down -v
```

> **Warning:** Using `docker compose down -v` permanently deletes the PostgreSQL database and Grafana data.
